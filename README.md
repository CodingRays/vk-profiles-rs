# VkProfiles RS

Rust bindings for the [Vulkan Profiles](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Profiles) library using [Ash](https://github.com/ash-rs/ash). The crate is designed as close as possible to Ash to allow for easy usage.

**Note: The vulkan loader must be statically linked in ash**

## Additional dependencies

These are required to build the vulkan profiles library
- A C++ compiler
- CMake
- Vulkan SDK. Only the vulkan headers are required for the build.
